Procedure
1. WHEN CORRECTIVE ACTION WILL BE INSTITUTED
Corrective action will be instituted, at the appropriate step, whenever an employee’s behavior or conduct is contrary or detrimental to Crossover Health’s Mission Statement, patient care standards, customer service standards, quality and safety standards, policies or procedures, in Crossover Health’s sole discretion.

Progressive levels of corrective action are planned to give an employee opportunities to recognize and alter any undesirable behavior and/or work performance. Depending on the severity of the misconduct; however, levels of progressive corrective action may be skipped and an employee may receive corrective action appropriate for the situation, including immediate termination of employment.

2. INVESTIGATION PRIOR TO CORRECTIVE ACTION
When an allegation of a work rule, policy or procedure violation, or any other situation possibly requiring corrective action has been reported to a supervisor, the supervisor shall immediately notify the HIPAA Security Officer (S.O.). The HIPAA Security Officer shall conduct an investigation to determine the validity of the accusation or the necessity of corrective action.
1. If the employee’s behavior is disruptive to normal business operations, inappropriate conduct, the HIPAA Security Officer along with Human Resources (HR) may immediately suspend the employee pending an outcome of the investigation. At the time of suspension, the HIPAA Security Officer and supervisor are responsible for retrieving the ID Badge and all Crossover Health property to include keys, pager, cell phone, etc.
2. The supervisor shall consult with Human Resources regarding the suspension, which will be unpaid. During the investigation it may be necessary to place the employee on an administrative leave.
3. If the nature and timing of the incident make consultation with Human Resources before the suspension impossible, it shall occur as soon as possible after the suspension on placement on administrative leave.
4. If after investigation, corrective action is not warranted, the employee will be reinstated, with pay, for time scheduled but not worked. Employee ID Badge and Crossover Health property will be returned to the employee upon return to work.
5. The HIPAA Security Officer shall gather all available facts surrounding the particular incident and/or the employee’s behavior, including giving the employee an opportunity to respond to the allegation. The investigation must be completed within the time line identified (14 calendar days). Human Resources may make exception to this time line if the investigative delay is caused by the temporary unavailability of an employee, a key member of management, a witness, or important information.
The HIPAA Security Officer shall investigate such matter using the following factors:
o the seriousness of the misconduct;
o the degree of the employee’s responsibility for the misconduct;
o the employee’s work and disciplinary history;
o the employee’s active violations, if any;
o the employee’s ability to correct the misconduct;
o consistency of application of corrective action throughout the department;
o the effect of the misconduct on other employees, patients, visitors, and others;
o the surrounding circumstances;
o as well as any other factors the HIPAA Security Officer regards as relevant to the investigation.
(This list is not to be construed as a requirement for corrective action.)
6. The HIPAA Security Officer, in consultation with Human Resources, will determine the appropriate level of corrective action to be taken. Care should be taken that the supervisor’s discretion ensures that the application of corrective action is reasonable and consistent with past practice. HR will investigate to ensure that the application of corrective action is reasonable and consistent with Crossover Health past practice.
7. All decisions resulting in termination must have the written approval of appropriate management and Human Resources, or his or her designee, prior to taking such action.

3. CORRECTIVE ACTION STEPS
1. Counseling (“Coaching”) Documented: Supervisors or managers generally initially counsel or “coach” employees to correct minor situations. By way of an informal discussion, such measures generally identify the problem, the results or improvements required, and the activities or steps which need to be taken to correct the situation. If the behavior continues, performance remains unsatisfactory, or if a specific problem is more serious, then a corrective action notice will be issued.
2. After an investigation has been made and a decision to apply corrective action has been made, the appropriate level of corrective action as follows, must then be determined. Corrective action may start at any of the following steps, and for subsequent misconduct may skip steps, depending on the factors stated in Section II.
3. Active Violations: Violations do not have to be of the same nature to warrant implementing more serious corrective action, including termination.
4. The corrective action steps are as follows:
o Step 1 Written corrective action notice
o Step 2 Written corrective action notice
o Step 3 Written corrective action notice
o Step 4 Written corrective action notice, with three (3) day suspension without pay (Suspension may be longer pending investigation)
o Step 5 Termination

Step One – Written corrective action notice
This is generally the first step for a Minor Infraction. When counseling has not been successful or where the circumstances warrant more severe corrective action, an employee shall receive a written corrective action notice. The employee will be asked to sign the corrective action documentation to acknowledge its receipt. If the employee refuses to sign, the department manager should document refused to sign with date.

Step Two – Written corrective action notice
When a Step One corrective action has not been successful or where the circumstances warrant more severe corrective action, an employee shall receive a second corrective action notice. The employee will be asked to sign the corrective action documentation to acknowledge its receipt. If the employee refuses to sign, the department manager should document refused to sign with date.

Step Three – Written corrective action notice
Generally, corrective actions for Major Infractions will start at Step Three or above. When a Step Two corrective action has not been successful or where the circumstances warrant more severe corrective action, an employee shall receive a third corrective action notice. The employee will be asked to sign the corrective action documentation to acknowledge its receipt. If the employee refuses to sign, the department manager should document refused to sign with date.

Step Four – Written corrective action notice and Suspension without Pay
In cases where corrective action has not been successful or where circumstances warrant more severe disciplinary action, a written corrective action accompanied with a suspension is the next step.

The employee will be asked to sign the corrective action documentation to acknowledge its receipt. If the employee refuses to sign, the department manager should document refused to sign with date. Corrective action suspensions are without pay and length may vary depending upon the severity of the corrective action. Generally a suspension is for three (3) days. Each day of suspension shall be equal to 8 hours of unpaid time. Suspensions require consultation with, and approval of, Human Resources.

A written corrective action and suspension must be documented and discussed with the employee. The documentation should include language warning the employee that this is his or her last chance to modify inappropriate conduct, or termination may result. The employee will be asked to sign the corrective action documentation to acknowledge its receipt.

Step Five - Termination
In cases where prior progressive corrective action has not been successful, an employee may be terminated from employment. In cases where the employee has dual employment (employed with more than one business unit or department within Crossover Health, the employee will be terminated from Crossover Health.

When a supervisor determines that termination is the appropriate action to be taken, the supervisor shall present the recommendation, together with all related documentation, to management for review. All decisions resulting in termination must have the written approval of appropriate management and the Human Resources, or his or her designee prior to taking such action.

Once the decision to terminate has been made, the supervisor should confer with Human Resources regarding informing the employee of the decision. Human Resources shall confer with the HIPAA Security Officer for any involuntary terminations prior to an employee’s termination.

4. DOCUMENTATION OF CORRECTIVE ACTION
All corrective action should be documented and include, at a minimum, the following information:
* a factual description of the nature of the problem being addressed;
* when the conduct/incident(s) occurred;
* witnesses or other involved parties;
* reference to previous corrective action that was issued specifically regarding this problem or regarding other misconduct;
* steps to be taken to correct the problem;
* if the next violation could result in termination, a statement to that effect;
* a time frame by which the correction must occur;
* as well as any other relevant information pertinent to the corrective actions

5. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF CORRECTIVE ACTION
When an employee is issued corrective action in person, the supervisor should review the action to be taken with the employee and ask the employee to sign the documentation to acknowledge that it has been reviewed with them. Acknowledging receipt and review of corrective action does not mean that the employee agrees with the supervisor’s determination or the corrective action.
If the employee fails to sign the documentation, the supervisor should note on form if employee refuses to sign and date. The employee should be given a copy of the corrective action documentation.

If the employee is unavailable in person at the time the corrective action is issued, the department management and/or a representative from Human Resources should contact the employee and arrange for a meeting. In the event the employee refuses to meet, Crossover Health will accept the refusal and terminate the employment.

6. RECORD RETENTION AND DOCUMENTATION
All corrective action documents shall be placed in an employee’s official personnel file in the Human Resource Department.
1. A corrective action is active for one-year (365 days) during which time the employee remains actively employed without a break in service due to a leave of absence. During this one-year (365 days) period, if the employee is not issued any additional corrective action notices, the corrective action notice will become inactive at the end of the one-year (365 days) period.
2. If employee was due a corrective action prior to a leave of absence, within five (5) days of employee returning from leave, a corrective action will be issued.
3. HIPAA Security Officer will maintain investigation and records of violations separately from any supervisor or Human Resource documents for no less than six (6) years.
4. Aside from its use as described above, all documents placed in an employee's personnel file shall be subject to Crossover Health’s record retention procedures.

7. NEWLY HIRED EMPLOYEES
Progressive corrective action is not available to employees still within their probationary period. Work rules, policy, procedure or other violations or misconduct may warrant immediate termination.

8. AVAILABILITY OF APPEALS PROCEDURE
In general, employees may appeal corrective action applied to them through Crossover Health’s Appeals Procedure. The policy will also describe violations that are not subject to appeal.

9. DISCRETION TO MODIFY POLICY
This policy is intended to serve as a guide and does not address all possible violations or corrective action, which may be taken. Crossover Health periodically reviews and revises its policies, and this policy, as with all others, is subject to change at Crossover Health’s discretion without prior notice. This policy supersedes all prior written policies on this subject.

Procedure
1. Upon hire, Human Resources (HR) assures that employee signature is captured with identifying credentials within the signature platform to ensure individuals are held accountable and responsible for actions initiated under their electronic signatures. Signatures are tracked within the system and time stamped.
2. The Privacy Officer will follow the Incident Response [Code Orange] protocol as outlined in Policies 11.a-11.e for evaluation and response of any complaint, disclosure that does not comply with Policies 13.c.-13.f., or breach. Incidents that were the result of an employee action will be reported to Human Resources (HR).
3. HR will review the incident with the employee’s manager and the Privacy and/or Security Officer to determine level of severity of the incident (e.g. inadvertent vs. malicious), whether it is an initial or subsequent occurrence by the employee, and appropriate action to the incident. A corrective action plan will be drafted by HR and the manager.
4. HR and the manager will discuss the corrective action plan with the employee in person. The employee will sign the correction action plan and will be given a copy. HR maintains a copy of all employee sanctions and action plans within a specified folder in the Crossover Health electronic document repository. 
5. If the infraction(s) meets the level of severity that poses a threat to the security of PHI, or where prior progressive corrective action has not been successful, an employee may be terminated from employment.
6. HR will report the outcome of the employee sanction to the Privacy Officer for documentation within the incident reporting system. All employee security incidents are tracked and maintained in the incident reporting system for seven years. 
7. Sanctions involving clinically licensed personnel will be reviewed by the Medical Group Committee and Credentialing. When applicable, the licensing agency will be notified by the Medical Group Committee Chair. The employee will also self-report as required by the state’s licensing agency.
